## Purpose

I built this project to practice building backend applications that utilize relational databases to store, update, and retrieve customer data. I use mysql for the database and the mysql2 node package to interact with the database in the server.js script.

## Functional Description

This app allows the user to track and manage their company's employees, departments, and job titles. The user can interact with the application in the following ways:
- Viewing all departments
- Viewing all job titles
- Viewing all employees
- Adding a department
- Adding a job title
- Adding an employee
- Updating an employee's title

After selecting an option, the program will either display the data the user requested or prompt the user for more information about the request.
